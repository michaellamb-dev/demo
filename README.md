This repository serves as the codebase for a Spring Boot lab project. Its primary use will be for generating content to be distributed on [michaellamb.dev](https://michaellamb.dev) with the goal of being an accessible and extensible tool available to help others get acquainted with OpenAPI development in Spring Boot.

Get up-to-speed with the project by checking out my blog post titled [Adding Swagger UI to Spring Boot projects](https://michaellamb.dev/spring/2022/09/15/spring-boot-swagger-ui-redux.html).
